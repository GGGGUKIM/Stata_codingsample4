# Stata_codingsample4
# The following folder contain the answers to one of the coding tests that I completed. This test involves using Stata to clean, wrangle, and visualize data, and build econometric models. The last part also involves using econometric knowledge to answer several short questions. The answers are my own work. Please do not distribute it without my permission.
